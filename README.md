# Indigo

## Setup

You will need a system with CMake set up and have suitable compilers installed (GCC and Clang are tested)

To build the project, run the following command. You can add other CMake flags as you see fit

```sh
cmake -B <builddir> .
cmake --build <builddir>
```

Alternatively, you can use the [CMake Tools Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) from VSCode and have it configure everything for you
